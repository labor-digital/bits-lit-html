# LABOR - Bits - Lit Html

While bits has the dedicated scope of working with server rendered HTML, and provides some
basic JS templating functionality, you might want to get a bit more sophisticated.

For this I trust in the standalone templating engine [lit-html](https://lit.dev/docs/libraries/standalone-templates/)
which is part of the [lit web component framework](https://lit.dev/).

## Installation

Install the plugin through npm:

```
npm install @labor-digital/bits-lit-html
```

Register it in your plugin section:

```typescript
import {BitApp} from '@labor-digital/bits';
import {LitHtmlPlugin} from '@labor-digital/bits-lit-html';

new BitApp({
    bits: { /* ... */},
    plugins: [
        new LitHtmlPlugin()
    ]
});
```
